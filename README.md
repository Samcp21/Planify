# Planify ToDo

Planify is a web application that allows you to organize your tasks efficiently. With this application, you can create, edit, delete and reorganize your tasks according to their status and priority. Using drag-and-drop functionalities, you can move your tasks between different statuses, such as "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done". The main goal of this application is to help you keep track of your pending tasks and improve your productivity.


## Features

- **Task Creation:** Allows users to create new tasks by specifying a title, description and image. If the image field is not completed, a GIF will be automatically added with reference to the title.

- **Task Editing:** Users can edit the title and description of existing tasks as needed.

- **Task Deletion:** Users can delete tasks that are no longer relevant or completed.

- **Task Reorganization:** Drag-and-drop functionality enables users to change the order of their tasks and move them between different states.

- **Multiple State Columns:** Tasks are organized into columns representing different states, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."

- **Responsive View:** The application adapts to different devices and screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop computers and mobile devices.
